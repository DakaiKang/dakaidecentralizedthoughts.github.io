[Simplex](https://simplex.blog/) is a partially synchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol designed by Ben Chan and Rafael Pass in 2023. It has recently been adopted by [Solana](https://solana.com/). 

Simplex is a simple and clean BFT protocol. Ben did a great job explaining it [from scratch](https://simplex.blog/). But if you are like me as someone already familiar with other BFT protocols such as PBFT or Tendermint, you may wonder how Simplex differs and what its core innovation is. This post is my attempt at understanding Simplex in relation to Tendermint. 

For simplicity, I will focus on one-shot consensus, i.e., agreeing on a single value. I will start from Tendermint. I will modify Tendermint into Simplex through a sequence of changes. I should clarify that it is most likely not the chain of thoughts that Ben and Rafael went through when designing Simplex. But this journal is helpful (at least for me) to understand the key idea in Simplex.
