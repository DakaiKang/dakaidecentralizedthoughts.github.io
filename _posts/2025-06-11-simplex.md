[Simplex](https://simplex.blog/) is a partially synchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol designed by Ben Chan and Rafael Pass in 2023. It is a simple and clean BFT protocol. Part of its design is being adopted by [Solana]{https://solana.com/}. Ben did a great job explaining it [from scratch](https://simplex.blog/). But if you are already familiar with other BFT protocols such as PBFT or Tendermint, you may be wondering how Simplex differs and what its core innovation is. This post is my attempt at understanding Simplex in relation to prior partially synchronous protocols.

In this post, I will start from Tendermint and modify a variant of Tendermint into Simplex. I should clarify that this is most likely not the chain of thoughts that Ben and Rafael went through when designing Simplex. But this exercise is helpful (at least for me) for understanding the key idea in Simplex. 

For simplicity, I will focus on single-shot consensus. There are standard techniques to extend a single-shot consensus protocol to a multi-shot one. There are n parties, up to f of which can be Byzantine. The protocol uses many standard techniques for partially synchronous BFT: it proceeds in views starting from view 1, each view has a designated leader, n-f votes from the same view form a certificate (cert for short), and certs are ranked by views. Let Cert(k, x) denote a collection of n-f votes from view k for value x. For convenience, we think of an empty string as Cert(0, x) for any x. Let &Delta; be the message delay upper bound after GST. All messages are signed and sent to all. 

----------------
Upon entering view k: <br>
    Everyone starts a local timer T <br>
    Leader waits for 2&Delta; time if k > 1 <br>
    Leader sends (Propose, k, x, Cert(k’, x)) for the highest k’ <br>
    
Upon receiving (Propose, k, x, Cert(k’, x)) in view k <br>
    Send (Vote, k, x) if having seen no Cert from a view higher than k' <br>
        
Upon receiving n-f (Vote, k, x) in view k      // Denote them Cert(k, x) <br>
    Send (Finalize, x, k) <br>
    Forward Cert(k, x) <br>     

Upon receiving n-f (Finalize, k, x) <br>
    Decide x <br>
    Forward these n-f (Finalize, k, x) <br>
    Terminate <br>
    
Upon T = 6&Delta; in view k <br>
    Send (View-change, k) <br>
    Exit view k

Upon receiving n-f (View-change, k) <br>
    Forward these n-f (View-change, k) <br>
    Enter view k+1 
    
----------------

Here are some main takeaways from the above protocol. First, the main idea of Tendermint is that an honest party refuses to vote if it has a higher cert than the one in the leader's proposal. This ensures safety. Here is a proof sketch. If some honest party decides x in view k, then n-2f honest parties have seen Cert(k, x). They will refuse to vote for any x' != x in the next view, so Cert(k+1, x') cannot form. Safety holds by induction.  

Second, the above design necessitates a crucial step in Tendermint: the leader needs to wait for 2&Delta; time before proposing. This is because we need an honest leader post-GST to receive __every__ honest party's reported cert. Otherwise, it is possible that some honest party p holds a high cert that the honest leader is unaware of. Then, p will refuse to vote for the honest leader, breaking liveness. The wait is set to 2&Delta; because post-GST, a party may enter the view up to &Delta; later than the leader and it takes up to &Delta; time for its cert to reach the leader. 

That also explains why the view-change timeout is 6&Delta;: &Delta; for leader to enter the view, 2&Delta; leader wait, and &Delta; delay for each of the three messages (Propose, Vote, Finalize). If a party does not decide within 6&Delta;, it requests a view-change. Upon receiving sufficient view-change requests, a party enters a new view. 

We are now ready to modify the protocol into Simplex. I have marked the changes in bold with numbered notes.

----------------
Upon entering view k: <br>
    Everyone starts a local timer T <br>
    <del>Leader waits for 2&Delta; time if k > 1 </del>      // Change #3 <br>
    Leader sends (Propose, k, x, Cert(k’, x)) for the highest k’ <br>
    
Upon receiving (Propose, k, x, Cert(k’, x)) in view k <br>
    Send (Vote, k, x) if having seen n-f (View-change, l) for all k' < l < k      // Change #2 <br>
        
Upon receiving n-f (Vote, k, x) in view k      // Denote them Cert(k, x) <br>
    Send (Finalize, x, k) <br>
    Forward Cert(k, x) <br>
    **Enter view k+1**        // Change #1 <br>

Upon receiving n-f (Finalize, k, x) <br>
    Decide x <br>
    Forward these n-f (Finalize, k, x) <br>
    Terminate <br>
    
Upon **T = 3&Delta;** in view k     // Change #4 <br>
    Send (View-change, k) <br>
    Exit view k

Upon receiving n-f (View-change, k) <br>
    Forward these n-f (View-change, k) <br>
    Enter view k+1 
    
----------------

The key innovation of Simplex lies in Changes #1 and #2. When an honest party sends Finalize in view k, it moves to the next view right away, so it will never send (View-change, k). Note also that if an honest party sends (View-change, k), it exits view k and will never send (Finalize, k, *). By the standard quorum intersection argument, this means n-f (View-change, k) and n-f (Finalize, k, *) are mutually exclusive! This property is __very__ interesting and unique to Simplex to my knowledge. 

In particular, this property enables Change #2. An honest party will vote for the leader's proposal as long as it has seen n-f View-change messages for every view higher than the leader's cert, __even if__ it has a higher cert. This behavior would be unsafe in Tendermint. It is safe in Simplex because the existence of n-f View-change for a given view is proof that no decision occurred in that view. 

Changes #3 and #4 are natural consequences of the previous two changes. Since an undetected higher cert no longer breaks liveness, the leader no longer needs to wait 2&Delta; before proposing. With the 2&Delta; wait removed and Change #1, the view-change timeout can be reduced to 3&Delta;. 

We have now arrived at the single-shot Simplex protocol. 

What efficiency improvement does Simplex achieve? In the best case when all leaders are honest and the network is synchronous, Simplex and Tendermint have the same behavior: a decision is finalized every three rounds at network speed. (This property is called optimistic responsiveness.) Simplex has an advantage over Tendermint when we have faulty leaders: every failed view lasts 3&Delta; instead of 6&Delta;, so it gets to an honest leader sooner. PBFT can have the same view duration as Simplex. Simplex's advantage over PBFT is that a leader's proposal is much shorter. 
 
**Footnotes**
1. Tendermint can achieve optimistic responsiveness [with some care](https://informal.systems/blog/tendermint-responsiveness). [HotStuff-2](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/397.pdf) gives a simpler way to achieve optimistic responsiveness. 
2. The view duration of Tendermint can be made shorter if we assume synchronized clocks and forgo optimistic responsiveness.
3. The comparison between Simplex and PBFT/Tendermint/HotStuff2 will be more nuanced if we consider message complexity, communication complexity, or fast path integration.
