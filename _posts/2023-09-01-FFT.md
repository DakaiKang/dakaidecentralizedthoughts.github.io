The Fast Fourier Transform ([FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)) developed by [Cooley and Tukey](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1965-19-090/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1.pdf) in 1965 has its origins in the work of [Gauss](https://www.cis.rit.edu/class/simg716/Gauss_History_FFT.pdf). The FFT, its variants and extensions to finite fields, are a fundamntal algorithmic tool and a beautiful example of interplay between algebra and combinatorics. There are many great recources on FFT, see [ingopedia's curated list](https://ingonyama-zk.github.io/ingopedia/fft.html).

Given a field $F$, a *polynomial of degree at most $d-1$* is defined as $P(X)=a_0+a_1 X+ \dots + a_{d-1} X^{d-1}$, where each $a_i \in F$. $P(X)$ can be viewed as a vector $\vec{a}=\langle a_0,\dots,a_{d-1} \rangle$ of $d$ elements in $F$.

Polynomials can also be *evaluated*. Given $d$ unique points $x_1,\dots,x_d$ in $F$, we can represent $P(X)$ as the vector $\vec{y}=\langle y_1,\dots,y_d \rangle$, where $y_i=P(x_i)$ is the evaluation of $P(X)$ on $x_i$.


In a [previous post](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-07-17-polynomial-secret-sharing-and-the-lagrange-basis/) we showed the isomorphism $\vec{a} \leftrightarrow \vec{y}$ between degree at most $d-1$ polynomials and their evaluations at $d$ unique points. Here we focus on the *computational* cost of this mapping: the number of field operations.

Given $\vec{a}$ for a polynomial of degree at most $d-1$, one can compute each $y_i=P(x_i)$ using [Horner's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method) via $O(d)$ field operations (observing that $P(X)=a_0+x(a_1+(x(a_2 + \dots + )))$ ). For a total of $O(d^2)$ operations to compute $\vec{y}$. Can we compute the *evaluation* $\vec{a} \to \vec{y}$ in better than quadratic?

Similarly, for $d$ unique points $\vec{x}$, it is possible to compute the $i$-th [Lagrange base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) polynomial $L_i(X)$ which equals 1 on $x_i$ and 0 for all $x_j, j \neq i$ using $O(d)$ operations as $L_i(X)=  \prod_{j \neq i} (X-x_j)/ \prod_{j \neq i} (x_i-x_j)$. So given evaluations $\vec{y}$, computing $P(X)= \sum_{i=1}^d y_i L_i(X)$ can be done in $O(d^2)$ operations. Can we compute the *interpolation* $\vec{y} \to \vec{a}$ in  better than quadratic? 

The *Fast Fourier Transform* allows interpolating and evaluating a polynomial on special points, [roots of unity](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-simple-math-behind-the-mighty-roots-of-unity-20210923/), with $O( d \log d)$ operations.


**Theorem**: 
* Given $d=2^D$ and a field $F$ of characteristic $p=qd+1$, let $\omega$ be a primitive $d$-th root of unity. There exists as algorithm that in $O(d \log d )$ operations: 
* Computes $P(\omega^0),\dots,P(\omega^{d-1})$ given the coeficeints of a degree at most $d-1$ polynomaial $P(X)$.
* Computes the coeficeints of the degree at most $d-1$ polynomaial $P(X)$ given $d$ evalutations $P(\omega^0),\dots,P(\omega^{d-1})$.

This result uses **two powerful ingrediants**: *divide-and-conquer*, and *roots of unity*. We start with the first direction: computing the evaluations given the coeficeints.

## The first ingredient: decompose a polynomial into its odd and even coefficients each with half the degree

Assume that $P(X)$ has degree at most $d-1$ and that $d=2^D$ is a power of two. A classic divide-and-conquer algorithm design principle when applied to polynomials is to "split" a degree at most $d-1$ polynomial into two degree at most $d/2-1$ polynomials by dividing the polynomial to its *even* and *odd* coeficients: 

$$
P(X)= P_e(X^2) + XP_o(X^2)  
\label{\star} \tag{*}
$$



Where $P_e(X),P_o(X)$ are polynomials induced by the *even* and *odd* coefficients of $P(X)$ as follows:
$$
P_e(X)=a_0 + a_2 X+ a_4 X^2 + \dots+ a_{d-2}X^{d/2 -1}
$$

$$
P_o(X)=a_1 + a_3 X+ a_5 X^2 + \dots+ a_{d-1}X^{d/2 -1}
$$


Here is a pictorial representation of the odd and even idexes:

Why is this such a powerful divide-and-conquer decomposition?

* Given $d$ evaluations $P_e(a_1^2),\dots,P_e(a_{d}^2)$ and $d$ evaluations $P_o(a_1^2),\dots,P_o(a_{d}^2)$, one can compute the desired $d$ evaluations $P(a_1),\dots,P(a_d)$  in $2d$ opertions, simply becasue $P(a_i)=P_e(a_i^2) + a_i P_o(a_i^2)$ via $(\ref{\star})$.
* The degree of $P_e(X)$ and $P_o(X)$ is at most $d/2-1$. So if we manage to repeat this recursion we can get $O(\log d)$ depth!
* However, to continue recursively there seems to be a *challenge*: 
    * $P_e(X)$ and $P_o(X)$ are of degree less than $d/2$, so from the recursion, we are given only $d/2$ (not $d$) evaluations $P_e(b_1),\dots,P_e(b_{d/2})$ and similarly $d/2$ (not $d$) evaluations for $P_o(X)$.
    *  However, to compute all $d$ evaluations of $P(X)$ via  $(\ref{\star})$ and we need the $d$ evaluations $P_e(a_0^2),\dots,P_e(a_{d}^2)$ and similarly the $d$ evaluations of squares for $P_o(X)$.
* How can we generate $d$ evaluations of squares from just $d/2$ evaluations using $O(d)$ operations?

## The second ingredient: use roots of unity

For $g \in F$, if $g^d=1$ then we call $g$ a *$d$-th root of unity*. Moreover, if $g^1,\dots,g^d$ generates $d$ distinct elements then we call $g$ a *primitive $d$-th root of unity*.

Suppose $g$ is such *a primitive $d$-th root of unity*. So $g,g^2,\dots, g^{d-1}, g^d=1$ forms a cyclic group of order $d$ with $d=2^D$. 

Now, if we start squaring these roots of unity, we can see a pretty cool pattern. Starting at the first elements, we get: 
$$(g^1)^2=g^2,(g^2)^2=g^4,...,(g^{d/2-1})^2=g^{d-2},(g^{d/2})^2=g^{d}=1$$ 
Since we got to the value $1$ at the $d/2$-th power, elements now start repeating!

$$(g^{d/2+1})^2=g^{d+2}=g^d\cdot g^2=g^2,(g^{d/2+2})^2=g^4,...,(g^{d})^2=g^{d}=1$$ 

So we can solve the *challenge* above:

* Evaluate $P_e(X)$ and $P_o(X)$ at the $d/2$ points $g^2,g^4, \dots, g^{d}=1$ that form the cyclic group of order $d/2$ of the $d/2$-th roots of unity. Repeating this seqeunce twice gives us $d$ evaluations at the squares of the cyclic group of order $d$. Each member of $d/2$ appears twice in the squares of $d$:

$$
(g)^2,(g^2)^2,\dots,(g^{d/2})^2=1,(g^{d/2 +1})^2=g^2,(g^{d/2 +2})^2=g^4,\dots,(g^d)^2=1
$$

**The $d/2$ evaluations of the $d/2$-th roots, repeated twice, give all the $d$ evaluations of squares of the $d$-th roots.** This was the missing piece to complete the divide-and-conquer!

As a visual example, fix $d=8$, every square of a power of $\omega_8$, say $(\omega_8^i)^2$ equals a power of $\omega_4$ (in particular $\omega_4^{i \bmod 4}$). For a specific example consider the squares of $\omega_8^3$ and $\omega_8^7$. Observe that  $(\omega_8^3)^2 = \omega_8^6 = \omega_4^3$ and similarly  $(\omega_8^7)^2 = \omega_8^{14} = \omega_8^{6} = \omega_4^3$:

#### Finding a primitve root of unity

If $F$ is a prime Field of characteristic $p=dq+1$ then we are guaranteed that for any $x$, $g=x^q$ is a $d$-th root of unity becasue $g^d = x^{qd}=x^{p-1}=1$ (using [Fermat's little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem)). It is easy to check that the $d$-th roots of unity form a multiplicative group, and hence a [cyclic group](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/54735/collecting-proofs-that-finite-multiplicative-subgroups-of-fields-are-cyclic). 

Choosing $x$ uniformly at random from $F\setminus \{0\}$ we get that $x^q$ is a uniformly random $d$-th roots of unity. 

To see why this is true, consider the fuction $f(x)=x^q$ and see that $\|x \text{ s.t. } x^q=y\|=q$ for all $y$. Indeed $f(x)$ maps a set of size $dq$ to a set of size at most $d$ (since $f(x)^d=1$ is a root of $x^d -1$ which can have at most $d$ roots). Finally, for any $y$ there can be at most $q$ values such that $x^q=y$. So $f(x)$ must map exactly $q$ elements to each of the $d$ options.

Since $d=2^D$ is even, the cyclic group of order $d$ has $d/2$ primitive roots (all the odd powers are generators). Moreover, if $g=x^q$ is not a primitive root, then it's an even power, so $g^{d/2} = 1$. 

That implies a simple Las Vegas algorithm: Randomly choose a nonzero $x \in F$, set $g=x^q$, and if $g^{d/2} \neq 1$ then output $g$, otherwise repeat. Since the probability of success is $1/2$, the expected number of rounds is 2.




### Computational cost of the FFT

Each time the degree is cut by half, the depth is $\log_2 d = D$. In each layer, there are $O(d)$ operations: at layer $i$ there are $2^i$ polynomials of degree $2^{d-i}$, each pair of polynomials requires  $2^{d-i+2}$ operations to compute the degree $2^{d-i+1}$ polynomial. For a total of $2^{i-1} \times 2^{d-i+2}= 2d$ operations.

So overall $2 d \log_2 d$ field operations.

## Interpolation: inverse FFT

Given $d$ evluations $P(\omega^1),\dots,P(\omega^d)$ can we interpolate and compute the coefficients $\vec{a}$ of $P(X)$ in $O(d \log d)$ operations? Yes, using the same two ingredients!

Let's look again at 
$$
P(X)= P_e(X^2) + XP_o(X^2)
$$

If we had $d/2$ evaluations, $P_e(\omega^2),P_e(\omega^4),\dots,P_e(\omega^d)$ and $d/2$ evaluations, $P_o(\omega^2),P_o(\omega^4),\dots,P_o(\omega^d)$ then we could recursively obtain the coeficients $\vec{b},\vec{c}$ of $P_e(X)$ and $P_o(X)$ respectivly.

Now via $(\ref{\star})$ get that $a_{2i}=b_i$ and $a_{2i-1}=c_i$ directly.

So the only challenge is to obtain $\vec{e}=P_e(\omega^2),P_e(\omega^4),\dots,P_e(\omega^d)$ and  $\vec{o}=P_o(\omega^2),P_o(\omega^4),\dots,P_o(\omega^d)$ from $\vec{y}=P(\omega^1),\dots,P(\omega^d)$.

As expected we will use the properties of roots of unity.

For any $1 \le j  \le d/2$ to $o_j$ and $e_j$ we start with two equations by evaluating $(\ref{\star})$ at $\omega^j$ and $\omega^{d/2+j}$:

$$
P(\omega^j) = P_e(\omega^{2j}) + \omega^j P_o(\omega^{2j})
$$

and

$$
P(\omega^{d/2+j}) = P_e(\omega^{2j}) - \omega^j P_o(\omega^{2j})
$$


Where in the second equation we use $\omega^{d+x}=\omega^x$ and $\omega^{d/2+x}= -\omega^x$. The latter follows from $\omega^{d/2}=-1$ which can be derived from $(\omega^{d/2})^2 -1 =0 = (\omega^{d/2}-1)(\omega^{d/2}+1)$. Now note that $\omega^{d/2} -1 \neq 0$ because $\omega$ is a primitive root of unity, so it must be that $\omega^{d/2} + 1 = 0$. 

Using the notation $y,e,o$ we get 

$$
y_j = e_j + \omega^j o_j
$$

and

$$
y_{d/2+j} = e_j - \omega^j o_j
$$

Adding both and dividing by 2 we get:

$$
e_j=(y_j+y_{d/2+j})/2
$$

While subtracting and dividing by $2\omega^j$ we get:

$$
o_j=(y_j-y_{d/2+j})/2\omega^j
$$

So we can compute $e_j,o_j$ using a constant number of field operations on $y_j,y_{d/2+j}, \omega^j$, hence compute all of them in $O(d)$ operations.

So again we have $O(\log d)$ layers of recursion and each layer requires $O(d)$ operaions for a total of $O(d \log d)$ operations.

### Inverse FFT via Inversion

The FFT is a linear transformation of the Vandermonde matrix where $V_{i,j}=\omega^{ij}$.  The *inverse matrix* is $U_{i,j}= \omega^{-ij}/d$. This can be seen as the $i,j$ value of the product $VU$ is $(VU)_{i,j} = \frac{1}{d} \sum_k \omega^{k(i-j)}$ which equals 1 for $i=j$ and 0 otherwise (all the members of the cyclic group cancel out each other). Hence running the regular FFT with $\omega^{-1}$ and dividing by $d$ is the same as multipling by the inverse $U$. Hence this obtains inverse FFT as well.



### Do we need roots of unity of powers of two?
The requirement to have a field of characteristic $q 2^D+1$ is limiting. What if we are using a field that does not have a large power of two as a root of unity, but we still want to work with large, degree at most $d-1$ polynomials? Recent work of [Ben-Sasson, Carmon,  Kopparty, and Levit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08473) shows how to do FFT for any field in $O(d \log d)$ operations!
