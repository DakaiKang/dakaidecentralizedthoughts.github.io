In this series of three posts, we discuss two of the most important consensus lower bounds:
1. [Lamport, Fischer \[1982\]](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/trans.pdf): any protocol solving consensus in the *synchronous* model that is resilient to $t$ crash failures must have an execution with at least $t+1$ rounds.
2. [Fischer, Lynch, and Patterson \[1983, 1985\]](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf): any protocol solving consensus in the *asynchronous* model that is resilient to even one crash failure must have an infinite execution.

The modern interpretation of these lower bounds is the following:
* **Bad news**: Without using randomness, asynchronous consensus is *impossible*, and synchronous consensus is *slow*.
* **Good news**: With randomization, consensus (both in synchrony and in asynchrony) is possible in a *constant expected number of rounds*. Randomness does not circumvent the lower bounds; it just reduces the probability of bad events implied by the lower bounds. In synchrony, the probability of slow executions can be made exponentially small. In asynchrony, termination happens  [almost surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely). Formally, the *probability measure* of the complement of the event of terminating in some finite number of rounds is zero.


### The plan: three posts

1. In this *first* post, we provide key *definitions* and prove an important *Lemma* about having some initial uncommitted configuration. This lemma shows that any consensus protocol has some initial input where the adversary has control over the decision value (it can cause it to be either 0 or 1). This lemma will then be used in both lower bounds.

2. In the [second post](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-12-15-synchrony-uncommitted-lower-bound/), we use the approach of [Aguilera and Toueg \[1999\]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.22.402&rep=rep1&type=pdf) to prove that any protocol solving consensus in the *synchronous* model that is resilient to $t$ crash failures must have an execution with at least $t+1$ rounds. The proof uses the definitions and the lemma in this post.

3. In the [third post](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-12-15-asynchrony-uncommitted-lower-bound/), we prove the celebrated [Fischer, Lynch, and Patterson \[1985\]](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf) result that any protocol solving consensus in the *asynchronous* model that is resilient to even one crash failure must have an infinite execution. The proof uses the same definitions and the lemma in this post.




### Definitions

#### The goal: Consensus
We assume $n$ parties. Each party is a state machine that has some *initial input* $\in \{0,1\}$. The state machine has a special *decide* action that irrevocably sets its *decision* $\in \{0,1\}$.

We say that a protocol $\mathcal{P}$ solves *agreement against $t$ crash failures* if in any execution with at most $t$ crash failures:
1. **Termination**: all non-faulty parties eventually decide.
2. **Agreement**: all non-faulty parties decide on the same value.
3. **Validity**: if all non-faulty parties have the same input value, then this is the decision value. 

#### Parties as State Machines
We model each party as a deterministic state machine, and model randomness by giving the state machine read-only access to a tape of random bits.
Each state machine has access to an immutable *input* register, a read-only *incoming-messages* queue, and a write-only *outgoing-messages* queue. At any given moment, the *local state* of a party is fully defined by the state of its state machine and the content of it input register and local message queues.

#### Protocol and message passing
A **protocol** for $n$ parties is a set of $n$ state machines. When a party wishes to send a message $m$ to a recipient party $p$, it locally writes $(m,p)$ on its outgoing-messages queue. The system then adds this event $e=(m,p)$ to a *global* set of *pending messages*. Once an event enters the pending messages set, the adversary can divide when to *deliver* the message (with some constraints that depend on the network model: synchrony or asynchrony). When event $e=(m,p)$ is delivered, the system adds the message $m$ to the local incoming-messages queue of party $p$.


#### Configuration
Given a protocol $\mathcal{P}$, a **configuration** of a system is just the state of all the parties and the set of all pending, undelivered messages. More formally, a configuration $C$ is a vector of *local states* and a set $C_M$ of pending messages. We say that $e\in C_M$ is a pending message and $e=(m,p)$ if the configuration $C$ has a pending message $m$ sent to a party $p$ that party $p$ did not receive yet.

#### Initial Configuration
Given a protocol $\mathcal{P}$, the **initial configuration** of the system is fully described by the vector of inputs. 

#### Deciding Configuration
**$C$ is a *deciding* configuration**:  if all non-faulty parties have decided in $C$. We say that $C$ is  *1-deciding* if the common decision value is 1, and similarly that $C$ is *0-deciding* if the decision is 0.

Note that it's easy to check if a configuration is deciding - just look at the local state of each non-faulty party.


#### Committed Configuration (informal)
The goal of a consensus protocol is for the system to eventually reach a deciding configuration (despite the adversary's control of the asynchrony and ability to corrupt parties). The *magic moment* of any consensus protocol is when the system reaches a *committed configuration*. This is a configuration where no matter what the adversary does from this point onwards, the eventual decision value is already *fixed*. Note that there is no obvious externally observable way to know if a configuration is indeed committed. In particular, parties need to learn that this is the case before they decide.

We choose to use new names to these definitions, which we feel provide a more intuitive and modern viewpoint. The classical name for a committed configuration is *univalent configuration*  and for an uncommitted configuration is  *bivalent configuration*.

#### Transitioning from one configuration to another

* We write **$C \rightarrow C'$**: If in configuration $C$ there is a pending message $e$ (or all undelivered messages $E$ in the synchronous model) such that configuration $C$ changes to configuration $C'$ by delivering $e$ (or delivering all $E$ in the synchronous model). 
When a pending message $e=(m,p)$ is *delivered*, then party $p$ receives message $m$ and locally processes it fully according to $\mathcal{P}$. Since the system is asynchronous, the full local processing will assume that all timers expire (for example, if $\mathcal{P}$ instructs $p$ to wait for 2 hours, then we wait for this timer to expire).
So the difference between $C$ and $C'$ is: (1) in the state of party $p$ after fully completing the processing of $e$; and (2) in the sent of pending messages of $C'$, $e$ is removed, and may contain new messages that are sent by $p$ to other parties due to the processing of $m$. 

* We write **$C \rightsquigarrow C'$**: If there exists a sequence $C = C_1 \rightarrow C_2 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow C_k=C'$ ($\rightsquigarrow$ is the [transitive closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_closure) of $\rightarrow$).




#### Uncommitted Configuration
**$C$ is an *uncommitted* configuration**:  if it has a future 0-deciding configuration and a future 1-deciding configuration. There exists $C \rightsquigarrow D_0$ and $C \rightsquigarrow D_1$ such that $D_0$ is 0-deciding  and $D_1$ is 1-deciding.

Said differently, an *uncommitted configuration* is a configuration where the adversary still has control over the decision value. There are some adversary actions (crash events, message delivery order) that will cause the parties to decide 0 and some adversary actions that will cause the parties to decide 1.

An uncommitted configuration is a state of a system as a whole, not something that can be observed locally. Note that there is no simple way to know if a configuration is uncommitted. It requires examining all the possible future configurations (all possible adversary actions).


#### Committed Configuration
**$C$ is a *committed* configuration**: if every future deciding configuration $D$ (such that $C \rightsquigarrow D$) is deciding on the *same* value. We say that $C$ is *1-committed* if every future ends in a 1-deciding configuration, and similarly that $C$ is *0-committed* if every future ends in a 0-deciding configuration.

Said differently, a *committed configuration* is a configuration where the adversary has no control over the decision value. When a configuration is committed to $v$, no matter what the adversary does, the decision value will eventually be $v$.

Note that there is no simple way to know if a configuration is committed or uncommitted. In particular, there is no local indication in the configuration, and it may well be that no party knows that the configuration is committed.

### The existence of an initial uncommitted configuration

With the new definitions, one way to state the validity property is: if all non-faulty parties have the same input $b$ then that initial configuration must be $b$-committed.

So perhaps all initial configurations are either 1-committed or 0-committed? The following lemma shows that this is not the case: every protocol that can tolerate even one crash failure must have some initial configuration that is *uncommitted*.

**Lemma 1 ([Lemma 2 of FLP85](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/trans.pdf))**: If $\mathcal{P}$ solves agreement against at least one crash failure, then $\mathcal{P}$ has an initial *uncommitted* configuration.

A recurring  **proof pattern** for showing the existence of an uncommitted configuration will appear many times in these three posts. We start by stating it in an abstract manner:
1. Proof by *contradiction*: assume all configurations are either 1-committed or 0-committed.
2. Define a notion of *local adjacency* that differ by just one party. Find *two adjacent* configurations $C$ and $C'$ such that $C$ is 1-committed and $C'$ is 0-committed.
3. Reach a contradiction due to an indistinguishability argument between the two adjacent configurations $C$ and $C'$. The adjacency allows the adversary to cause indistinguishability via *crashing of just one* party.

**Proof of the Lemma 1** follows the proof pattern above:
1. Seeking a contradiction, assume there is no initial configuration that is uncommitted. So all initial configurations are either 1-committed or 0-committed.
2. Define two initial configurations as *$i$-adjacent* if the initial value of all parties other than party $i$ are the same. Consider the sequence (or path) of $n+1$ adjacent initial configurations: $(1,\dots,1),(0,1,\dots,1),(0,0,1\dots,1),\dots,(0,\dots,0)$. Clearly, the leftmost is 1-committed and the rightmost is 0-committed. Obviously, there must be some party $i$ such that the two $i$-adjacent configurations $C,C'$ are 1-committed and 0-committed, respectively.
3. Now consider in both configurations $C$ and $C'$ the execution where party $i$ crashes right at the start of the protocol. We now have two configurations $\hat{C}, \hat{C'}$. Observe that these two configurations are indistinguishable for all non-faulty parties. So the non-faulty parties must decide the same value in any future of $\hat{C}$ and $\hat{C'}$. This is a contradiction to the assumption that $C$ is 1-committed and ,$C'$ is 0-committed.

This proves that any protocol $\mathcal{P}$ must have some initial uncommitted configuration. The next two posts will use the existence of an initial uncommitted configuration and extend it to more rounds!


**Proof by example for n=3**:
Consider the 4 initial configurations $(1,1,1), (0,1,1),(0,0,1),(0,0,0)$. By validity, configuration $(1,1,1)$ must be 1-committed and configuration $(0,0,0)$ must be 0-committed. Seeking a contradiction, let's assume none of the 4 initial configurations is uncommitted. So both $(0,1,1)$ and $(0,0,1)$ are committed. Since all 4 initial configurations are committed there must be two adjacent configurations that are committed to different values. Without loss of generality, assume that $(0,1,1)$ is 1-committed and $(0,0,1)$ is 0-committed. Now suppose that in both configurations, party 2 crashes right at the start of the protocol. Observe that both configurations look like $(1,CRASH,0)$. So both worlds must decide the same, but this is a contradiction because one is 1-committed and the other is 0-committed.  


#### Minimal validity condition
Note that all this proof required was the existence of one 1-committed initial configuration and one 0-committed initial configuration.
