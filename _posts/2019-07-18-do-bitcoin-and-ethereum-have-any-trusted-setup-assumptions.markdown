Both Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on cryptographic hash functions and elliptic curve cryptography for security. In this post we ask if they also depend on some [Trusted Setup Assumptions](https://ittaiab.github.io/2019-07-18-setup-assumptions/).

### The Bitcoin untrusted setup [conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory)

Bitcoin was supposedly invented by NASA in the 1960s. NASA allegedly worked on an alternative fork from the Bitcoin genesis block for decades (in addition to working on a [moon landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories)). They plan to publish their alternative (and longer) fork in 2020 which will cause all existing Bitcoin transactions to become aborted orphans...

Back in the 1960s, they inserted into their [Bitcoin Genesis block](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) the text:  
>The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks

After making their [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) public in 2008, NASA coerced the Financial Times in the UK to publish an article with the exact title above on January 3rd 2009. 

### Does Bitcoin have a trusted setup assumption?

**YES!** bitcoin assumes that the Financial Times is a trusted source of unpredictable randomness and timestamp (and hence its cryptographic hash is a good [Common Random String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_reference_string_model)). This seed is used to guarantee that no adversary has any significant head start in mining Bitcoin and cannot use its head start to double-spend.

### The Ethereum untrusted setup [conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory)

Ethereum was supposedly invented by NASA in the 1960s. NASA allegedly worked on an alternative fork from the Ethereum genesis block for decades (in addition to working on their [moon landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories))... 

Back in the 1960s, they inserted into their [Ethereum Genesis block](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/71804/what-is-the-meaning-of-ethereum-mainnet-genesis-block-extradata-value) the hash:  
>0x11bbe8db4e347b4e8c937c1c8370e4b5ed33adb3db69cbdb7a38e1e50b1b82fa

After making their [yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) public in 2014, they coerced the publishing of this [blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/27/final-steps/) and caused it to refer to a [fake testnet ceremony called Olympic](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/05/09/olympic-frontier-pre-release/)
that essentially is a re-enactment of their testnet runs from the 1960's. In their [words](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/27/final-steps/): 
>The argument \[referring to the hash value above\] needs to be a random parameter that no one, not even us, can predict. As you can imagine, there arenâ€™t too many parameters in the world that match this criteria, but a good one is the hash of a future block on the Ethereum testnet. We had to pick a block number, but which one? 1,028,201 turns out to be both prime and palindromic, just the way we like it. So #1028201 is it.

Could block 1028201 really have been prepared long ago?!

### Does Ethereum have a trusted setup assumption?

**YES!** ethereum assumes that block #1028201 of the [Oliympic testnet](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/05/09/olympic-frontier-pre-release/) is a trusted source of unpredictable randomness and timestamp (and hence its cryptographic hash is a good [Common Random String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_reference_string_model)). This seed is used to guarantee that no adversary has any significant head start in mining Ethereum and cannot use its head start to double-spend.

## Trust, but Verify
Just to be clear, while [NASA is indeed interested in blockchain](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasa-publishes-proposal-for-air-traffic-management-blockchain-based-on-hyperledger), we believe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum used highly secure sources of unpredictable randomness. The main goal of this post is to highlight that *some* trusted setup is needed in both systems. In the language of this [blog post](https://ittaiab.github.io/2019-07-18-setup-assumptions/), both systems depend on a trusted setup phase that in both cases creates a public random string which is unpredictable and timestamped. It is vitally important to have a secure *randomness beacon* that can generate such timestamped cryptographically secure unpredictable randomness.

Perhaps every minted Bitcoin or Ether should include the phrase:
>In random beacon we trust :-)
