In this series of posts, we explore the mathematical foundations of polynomials over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)). These objects are at the heart of several results in computer science: [secret sharing](https://cs.jhu.edu/~sdoshi/crypto/papers/shamirturing.pdf),
[Multi Party Computation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/136.pdf), [Complexity](https://lance.fortnow.com/papers/files/ip.pdf), and [Zero](https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2010/6477178/6477178.pdf) [Knowledge](https://cyber.biu.ac.il/event/the-9th-biu-winter-school-on-cryptography/) [protocols](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf).

All this wonder and more can be traced back to a very useful fact about polynomials over a field:

**Theorem: any non-trivial polynomial over a field of degree at most $d$ has at most $d$ zeroes**

Let us slowly unpack this statement.
Let $K$ be a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)) and let $p_0,...,p_m \in K$ be _coefficients_.
A polynomial over $K$ is an element of $K[X]$. Here is an example of one:

$$
p=p_0+p_1 X + p_2 X^2 + p_3 X^3 +...+ p_{m-1} X^{m-1} + p_m X^m
$$

 Recall that a field supports both multiplication and division (i.e., every element has a unique multiplicative inverse). Note that the set of [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring) $K[X]$ is a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)), so it supports multiplication, but not every element has a multiplicative inverse (more on division in $K[X]$ later).

We say that a polynomial $p$ is *non-trivial* if some coefficient $p_i \neq 0$. Then, we define the *degree* of $p$ to be the maximal $i$ such that $p_i \neq 0$ (it is natural to define the degree of the trivial polynomial to be $- \infty$).

We say that $a \in K$ is a *zero* of $p \in K[X]$ if $p(a)=0$ and say that $p$ has *at most $d$ zeroes* if there are at most $d$ elements in $K$ that are a zero of $p$. The zeroes of polynomials are also referred to as *roots*.

For example, consider the polynomial $p=2X-4$. It is clearly a polynomial of degree one and we all know that, over the rational field $K=\mathbb{Q}$, it has just one zero (at $2$).  Now, consider that same polynomial over the finite field $K=\mathbb{Z}_7$, which are just the integers modulo 7: i.e., $\\{0,1,2,\dots,6\\}$.
Then, a quick check shows that $2$ is still the only zero of $p$. In other words, the equation $2X=4 \pmod 7$ has exactly one solution: $2$.

Note that if instead of a field $K=\mathbb{Z}\_7$ we chose a _ring_ $K=\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, then the equation $2X=4 \pmod {12}$ would have 2 (!) solutions: $2$ (because $2\times 2 - 4 = 0$) and $8$ (because $2\times 8 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12$, which is equal to 0 modulo 12). In other words, $p$ has more zeros (two) than its degree (one)!

**Proof of the Theorem:**
Not surprisingly, the proof will be via induction on $d$. 

For $d=0$, since $p$ is non-trivial, we have $p_0 \neq 0$ and hence $p$ has no zeros (as it should be).

For $d=1$, as exemplified above, we will use the fact that $K$ is a field. 
Note that the unique zero of $p=p_0+p_1 X$ is the unique element $-p_0/p_1 = -(p_0) (p_1)^{-1}$. 
In particular, if $K$ were just a ring and not a field (e.g., $K=\mathbb{Z}_{12}$), then the inverse of $p_1$ may not exist or, more worrisome, may not be unique!

For $d\geq 2$, we will use an induction step. There are two cases.
First, if $p$ has no zeroes, then we are done.
Otherwise, let $a \in K$ be such that $p(a)=0$. Suppose that we could prove that there exists a polynomial $q$ of degree $<d$ such that $p=(X-a) q$. Since $q$ has a degree that is smaller than $d$ we can use the induction hypothesis on $q$. So $p$ can have at most $d-1$ zeros from $q$ and at most one more zero (at $a$) from the degree 1 polynomial $X-a$.

So to complete the induction argument we need to prove the existence of such $q$ using the following claim:

**Claim: if $p$ has degree $d\ge 1$ and $p(a)=0$ then there exists $q$ such that $p=(X-a)q$ and $q$ has a lower degree than $p$**

Not surprisingly, we will prove this claim by induction as well. For $d=1$, we again use the fact that $K$ is a field and can set $a= (p_0) (p_1)^{-1}$ and $q=p_1$ is a non-trivial degree zero polymonial.

For $d>1$, we will define a new polynomial $p' = p - p_d X^{d-1} (X-a)$, note that $p_d$ is the largest coefficeint of $p$. Lets make a few observations:
1. The degree of $p'$ is smaller than $d$. This is because the $d$th coefficient of $p_d X^{d-1} (X-a)$ equals $p_d$, so it will cancel out.
2. $p'$ has the property that $p'(a)=0$. This is because $p(a)=0$ and because $p_d X^{d-1} (X-a)$ also zeros at $a$.

Hence, we can apply the induction hypothesis on $p'$ to obtain that there exists $q'$ such that $p'=(X-a)q'$ and the degree of $q'$ is lower than $d-1$.

Since:

$$
p=p'+ p_d X^{d-1} (X-a)
$$

Then, we can substitute $p'=(X-a)q'$ and get:

$$
p= (X-a)q' + (X-a) p_d X^{d-1}
$$

Hence, we have proved that:

$$
p= (X-a)q\ \text{with}\ q=q'+p_d X^{d-1}
$$

It is direct to see that $q$ has degree $d-1$.

In the next posts, we will use this very useful fact about roots of polynomials over finite fields.
First, we will use it as the foundation for [secret sharing](/2020-07-17-polynomial-secret-sharing-and-the-lagrange-basis) and then as the foundation for Zero Knowledge Proofs.

A significantly more general result about polynomials over a field views them as a special case of a [unique factorization domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain). This view exposes deep connections between the natural numbers, polynomials over a field, and the [fundamental theorem of Arithmetic](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/Maths/Courseware/Primality/Primality.pdf).
