This page is a dynamically changing index of all posts on Decentralized Thoughts. Over time it will contain material for a graduate course on Blockchains (currently with a focus on consensus, but stay tuned). You can read all the posts chronologically [here](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/).

We would love to get your feedback and thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ittaia/status/1421066572207169544?s=20).


# Basics, Foundations, and Classics

You can start with the definition of [Consensus and Agreement](/2019-06-27-defining-consensus/). Then learn about the [network model](/2019-06-01-2019-5-31-models/), the [threshold adversary](/2019-06-17-the-threshold-adversary/) model, and the [power of the adversary](/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/). Finally, many protocols need a [trusted setup phase](/2019-07-19-setup-assumptions/). You can learn about different [relaxations of Broadcast](/2019-10-22-flavours-of-broadcast/).

Checkout out our [consensus cheat sheet](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-10-29-consensus-cheat-sheet/) for a quick overview of what is possible and impossible.

[Approximate agreement](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-06-07-approx-agreement-one/) is a variation that considers rational input values.

## Synchronous Protocols

Under synchrony, a classic Byzantine Broadcast protocol is the [Dolev-Strong Authenticated Broadcast protocol](/2019-12-22-dolev-strong/). You can read about more recent protocols such as [Sync HotStuff](/2019-11-12-Sync-HotStuff/), an [optimal optimistically responsive synchronous protocol](/2020-06-12-optimal-optimistic-responsiveness/), and simple streamlined synchronous protocol called [Streamlet](/2020-05-14-streamlet/). For more related work there is a survey of [authenticated protocols under the synchrony assumption](/2019-11-11-authenticated-synchronous-bft/).

For a simple and classic Synchronous Byzantine agreement protocol, checkout [Phase-King](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-06-09-phase-king-via-gradecast/).

For a simple non-equivocation protocol, checkout [Crusader Broadcast](). 


## Partially Synchronous Protocols

[Partial synchrony](/2019-09-14-flavours-of-partial-synchrony/) is one of the most used models in real word systems today.

Modern variants of the classic protocols of Paxos and Raft are covered in [Benign Hotstuff](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-04-02-benign-hotstuff/) and [Simplifing Raft with Chaining](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-07-17-simplifying-raft-with-chaining/). [Log Paxos](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-09-30-distributed-consensus-made-simple-for-real-this-time/) is a modern take on multi-Paxos. It's both surprisingly simple and concretely efficient. 

For Byzantine adversaries, checkout [Information Theoretic HotStuff](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-09-20-information-theoretic-hotstuff-it-hs-part-one/).

## Asynchronous Protocols

One of the core challenges of distributed computing is tolerating failures in an asynchronous network. The classic [FLP lower bound](/2019-12-15-consensus-model-for-FLP/) is a fundamental result showing the impossibility of consensus under even one crash fault. 

A fundamental building block in asynchrony is the [Reliable Broadcast](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-09-19-living-with-asynchrony-brachas-reliable-broadcast/) protocol. 

How do you measure [round complexity in asynchrony](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-09-29-the-round-complexity-of-reliable-broadcast/) (and can you improve the round complexity of reliable broadcast)? 

The multi-leader generalization of reliable broadcast is called [Reliable Gather](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-03-26-living-with-asynchrony-the-gather-protocol/). 

Our series on the marvels of Asynchronous Agreement: we (1) [define the problem](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-03-30-asynchronous-agreement-part-one-defining-the-problem/); (2) present [Ben-Or's protocol](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-03-30-asynchronous-agreement-part-two-ben-ors-protocol/); (3) provide a [modern version](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-03-30-asynchronous-agreement-part-three-a-modern-version-of-ben-ors-protocol/); (4) Introduce [Crusader Agreement and Binding Crusader Agreement](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-04-05-aa-part-four-CA-and-BCA/); and (5) use it to efficiently solve [Binary Byzantine Agreement from a strong common coin](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-04-05-aa-part-five-ABBA/).
 


# State Machine Replication

We begin by defining [state machine replication](/2019-10-15-consensus-for-state-machine-replication/) (SMR) and talk about different degrees of [SMR fault tolerance](/2019-10-25-flavours-of-state-machine-replication/) and the [ideal state machine model and Linearizability](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-10-16-the-ideal-state-machine-model-multiple-clients-and-linearizability/). The scalability and performance of a State Machine Replication system is not just about [consensus, but also about data and execution](/2019-12-06-dce-the-three-scalability-bottlenecks-of-state-machine-replication/).

Start with a [simple SMR for crash failures](/2019-11-01-primary-backup/). Extend SMR to omission failures. [First via single shot](/2020-09-13-synchronous-consensus-omission-faults/) and then via the [lock-commit](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-11-30-the-lock-commit-paradigm-multi-shot-and-mixed-faults/) paradigm to [multi-shot consensus](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-11-30-the-lock-commit-paradigm-multi-shot-and-mixed-faults/).


In partial synchrony, [Log Paxos](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-09-30-distributed-consensus-made-simple-for-real-this-time/) shows how to extend Paxos to multi-Paxos in a straightforward and efficient manner.




# Lower Bounds

Lower bounds give us powerful tools to understand the fundamental limitations and model assumptions. 

- Folklore: [Consensus with Omission failures](/2019-11-02-primary-backup-for-2-servers-and-omission-failures-is-impossible/) requires $f<n/2$.

- Dwork, Lynch, Stockmeyer 1988 ([DLS](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf)) lower bound: [Byzantine Consensus in Partial Synchrony](/2019-06-25-on-the-impossibility-of-byzantine-agreement-for-n-equals-3f-in-partial-synchrony/) requires $f<n/3$.

- Fischer, Lynch, Merritt ([FLM](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/FischerLynchMerritt-dc.pdf))lower bound: [Byzantine Consensus with no PKI](/2019-08-02-byzantine-agreement-is-impossible-for-$n-slash-leq-3-f$-is-the-adversary-can-easily-simulate/) (or more generally when the adversary can simulate) requires $f<n/3$. 

- Strengthening the FLM lower bound: [Crusader Agreement with $\leq 1/3$ Error is Impossible for $n\leq 3f$ if the Adversary can Simulate](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-10-04-crusader-agreement-with-dollars-slash-leq-1-slash-3$-error-is-impossible-for-$n-slash-leq-3f$-if-the-adversary-can-simulate/).

- Dolev and Reischuk 1982 ([DR](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/pubs/p132-dolev.pdf)) lower bound: [Consensus often needs a quadratic number of messages](/2019-08-16-byzantine-agreement-needs-quadratic-messages/).

- Fischer, Lynch, Paterson 1985 ([FLP](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf)) lower bound: Consensus must have some initial state that is [uncommitted](/2019-12-15-consensus-model-for-FLP/) and this imples [executions with at least $f+1$ rounds in Synchrony](/2019-12-15-synchrony-uncommitted-lower-bound/) and [non-terminating executions in Asynchrony](/2019-12-15-asynchrony-uncommitted-lower-bound/) (the FLP impossibility).

-  Ben-Or, Kelmer, Rabin 1994 ([BKR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/197917.198088)) lower bound: Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing must have a [non-zero probability of not terminating](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-07-15-asynchronous-fault-tolerant-computation-with-optimal-resilience/).

- Raft does not guarantee liveness under [omission faults](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-12-12-raft-liveness-full-omission/).

- CJKR lower bound: Neither Non-equivocation nor Transferability alone is enough for [tolerating minority corruptions in asynchrony](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-06-14-neither-non-equivocation-nor-transferability-alone-is-enough-for-tolerating-minority-corruptions-in-asynchrony/).

# Blockchains

What was the [first blockchain (or how to timestamp a digital document)](/2020-07-05-the-first-blockchain-or-how-to-time-stamp-a-digital-document/)?  Do proof-of-work blockchains need any [setup assumptions?](/2019-07-18-do-bitcoin-and-ethereum-have-any-trusted-setup-assumptions/) What does [checkpointing a blockchain](/2019-09-13-dont-trust-checkpoint/) mean?  What is [Nakamoto Consensus](/2021-10-15-Nakamoto-Consensus/)? How do you [prove it is secure](/2019-11-29-Analysis-Nakamoto/). What is the problem of [selfish mining](/2020-02-26-selfish-mining/)?

The simplest L2 solution is a [payment channel](/2019-10-25-payment-channels-are-just-a-two-person-bfs-smr-systems/).
